Experimented with CSS Variables for the first time. Changing them with JS could be handy in games and applications.
The fact that these variables are scoped withing the element you place them on is also powerful. Could be used for
components. Also nice that this way you also get the benefits of cascading and inheritance: variables can be overwritten
on a deeper level for some components, while for other components keeping the upper defined "default" value.
